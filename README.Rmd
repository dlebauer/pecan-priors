pecan-priors
============

demonstration of methods used to elicit priors from data and expert knowledge

The goal of this package is two-fold

1. to isolate and refine the prior elicitation functions used in PEcAn (and originally developed around the priors.Rnw and results.Rnw files in the PEcAn 1.1 repository (the official / published) implementations of these functions http://hdl.handle.net/2142/34655
2. to provide access to prior elicitation tools for end users. 

open priors_demo.Rmd to work in R; or priors_demo.html to see results.
