pecan-priors
============

demonstration of methods used to elicit priors from data and expert knowledge

The goal of this package is two-fold

1. to isolate and refine the prior elicitation functions used in PEcAn (and originally developed around the priors.Rnw and results.Rnw files in the PEcAn 1.1 repository) 
2. the working version is in the PEcAn 1.1 repository 
2. to provide access to prior elicitation tools for end users. 

open priors_demo.Rmd to work in R; or priors_demo.html to see results.
